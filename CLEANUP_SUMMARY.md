### Verification Status:
- ✅ TypeScript type-check: PASSED
- ✅ ESLint: PASSED (warnings only)

### What Was Kept:
- 31 actively used Figma assets
- All avatars (used in search results)
- All icons (used in UI components)
- Product images (used in carousel)
- Special files (manifest.json)

### Safe Cleanup Process:
1. Created `cleanup/unused-assets` branch
2. Moved unused assets to `.trash-assets/` (not deleted)
3. Added `.trash-assets/` to `.gitignore`
4. Verified build and tests pass

### Next Steps:
1. Test the application visually to ensure all images load
2. After verification, permanently delete `.trash-assets/` folder
3. Consider optimizing remaining large images with compression

### Files Generated:
- `unused-assets-report.md` - Detailed analysis
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary
- `.trash-assets/` - Backup of removed files (76 MB)

### Command to permanently delete backup:
```bash
rm -rf .trash-assets/
```

Only run this after thorough testing!
