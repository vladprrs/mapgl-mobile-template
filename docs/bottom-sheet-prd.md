# Bottom Sheet Component - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The Bottom Sheet is a mobile-first UI component that provides a draggable overlay interface for displaying contextual content over a map view. It serves as the primary interaction mechanism for accessing location details, search results, and additional map-related functionality.

## Product Vision

Create an intuitive, performant bottom sheet component that seamlessly integrates with map interactions, providing users with easy access to content while maintaining map visibility and interaction capabilities.

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Mobile users interacting with map-based applications
- **Use Cases**: Location search, place details, route information, filters and settings

## Core Requirements

### 1. Positioning and Layout

**Requirement**: The bottom sheet must be anchored to the bottom edge of the viewport
- Must remain flush with the screen bottom at all snap positions
- No visual gaps or detachment from the bottom boundary
- Must work across different device sizes and orientations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Sheet bottom edge aligns perfectly with screen bottom (0px gap)
- Maintains anchoring during all transitions and gestures
- Responsive to viewport changes (orientation, keyboard)

### 2. Snap Point System

**Requirement**: Support multiple predefined positions for the sheet
- Default snap points: 10% (collapsed), 50% (half), 90% (expanded)
- Configurable snap points via props
- Smooth transitions between snap positions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Sheet snaps to closest position when gesture ends
- Smooth animation transitions (cubic-bezier)
- Visual feedback during dragging with rubber band effect

### 3. Gesture Controls

**Requirement**: Multi-modal gesture support for natural interaction

#### 3.1 Handle Dragging
- Draggable handle at top of sheet for direct manipulation
- Visual indicator (handle bar) for affordance
- Precise tracking during drag operations

#### 3.2 Touch Gestures
- Touch and drag on sheet content to control position
- Distinguish between sheet movement and content scrolling
- Velocity-based snapping for natural feel

#### 3.3 Mouse Wheel Support
- Desktop compatibility via mouse wheel gestures
- Same behavior as touch for consistent UX
- Respects gesture context (sheet vs content)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All gesture types work consistently
- No conflicting interactions between gesture modes
- Responsive feedback during all gesture operations

### 4. Content Scrolling

**Requirement**: Intelligent content scrolling when sheet is expanded
- Content scrollable only when sheet is at maximum expansion (90% expanded snap point)
- Scroll behavior doesn't interfere with sheet positioning
- Clear visual boundaries for scrollable content

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Content scrolling only available in expanded state (90% snap point)
- Sheet position takes priority over content scroll in collapsed states
- Smooth transition between sheet control and content scroll modes

### 5. Performance Requirements

**Requirement**: Smooth 60fps interactions across all devices
- No jank during gesture interactions
- Efficient re-rendering strategies
- Optimized for mobile performance

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Gesture response time < 16ms
- Smooth animations without frame drops
- Minimal impact on main thread during interactions

### 6. TypeScript Support

**Requirement**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Generic interfaces for extensibility
- Runtime type validation where appropriate

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Complete autocomplete for all props and methods
- Proper type inference for callback functions

### 9. Testing Coverage

**Requirement**: Comprehensive test coverage
- Unit tests for all hooks and utilities
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for user workflows

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Minimum 90% code coverage
- All user interaction paths tested
- Cross-browser compatibility verified

## User Experience Requirements

### 10. Visual Design

**Requirement**: Modern, clean interface that complements map design
- Rounded top corners for visual depth
- Subtle shadow for layering
- Consistent spacing and typography

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Matches overall application design system
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Appropriate contrast ratios for accessibility

### 11. Response Time

**Requirement**: Immediate feedback for all user interactions
- Instant visual response to touch
- No perceived lag during transitions
- Clear loading states when needed

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Touch response < 100ms
- Animation starts immediately upon gesture
- Loading indicators appear within 200ms

### 12. Error Handling

**Requirement**: Graceful degradation for error scenarios
- Fallback behavior when gestures fail
- Recovery from invalid states
- User-friendly error messages

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- No crashes from invalid prop combinations
- Automatic recovery from gesture conflicts
- Clear error messages for developers

## Success Metrics

### User Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate**: >95% for accessing content via bottom sheet
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating for interaction smoothness
- **Error Rate**: <1% for gesture-related issues

### Technical Metrics
- **Performance**: 60fps maintained during all interactions
- **Bundle Size**: <10KB gzipped for core functionality
- **Load Time**: Component ready within 500ms

### Quality Metrics
- **Bug Reports**: <5 critical issues per month
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for all modules
- **Accessibility Score**: 100% on automated audits

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- React 19+ with hooks support
- Next.js 15+ for SSR capabilities
- TypeScript 5+ for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Browser Support
- iOS Safari 14+
- Chrome for Android 90+
- Chrome Desktop 90+
- Firefox Desktop 88+
- Edge 90+

### Performance Constraints
- Mobile-first optimization required
- Low-end device compatibility
- Network-independent functionality

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- **Multiple Sheets**: Support for multiple bottom sheets
- **Custom Animations**: Configurable transition curves
- **Nested Scrolling**: Complex nested scroll scenarios

### Phase 3 Features
- **Backdrop Interaction**: Tap outside to collapse
- **Swipe Gestures**: Horizontal swipe actions
- **Persistent State**: Remember user preferences

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles
1. **Mobile-First**: Design and test on mobile devices first
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality without JavaScript
3. **Performance Priority**: Prioritize smooth interactions over features
4. **Accessibility First**: Include accessibility from initial implementation

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow existing project conventions
- Comprehensive TypeScript types
- Extensive test coverage
- Clear documentation and examples

### Review Criteria
- All requirements met and tested
- Performance benchmarks passed
- Accessibility audit completed
- Cross-browser testing verified
